# FESTIVAL OF FLAWLESS VICTORY

In 2007 and 2011, +J. Walton hosted the Festival of Flawless Victory (  #FlawlessVictory  ) for finishing work (usually a new draft) on unfinished projects.

Over the course of these events, significant work was done on such games as: Geiger Counter, In a Wicked Age, A Flower for Mara, It's Complicated, Anima Prime, Mythender, Monster of the Week, Left Coast, and several others.

Ultimately, SabreGreatWolf, Fey Wray, Powell Driver, D. Vincent, The Kenrick Man, Major Hickory, Wordman, and SandStorm were declared champions and eternal Flawless Grand-Champions.

Now... the fighters have been recalled to the arena. The deathmatch for the fate of two worlds -- the real world and the corrupted world of imagination -- is at hand! Who will you fight? How will you write your name on the eternal role of champions?

## The Eternal Rules of the Eternal Festival

Games are easy to start, but sometimes hard to finish. They are the like the green vegetables of the mind.

Here's the eightfold path to achieving Flawless Victory:

1. Name your unfinished business.
2. Pick a reasonable deadline for finishing it.
3. Laugh loudly and arrogantly. HA HA HA! This is not optional.
4. Pick a ridiculous deadline that is very imminent instead. One that makes Goro wince with its harshness.
5. FINISH HIM!
6. Post a link to your game and gloat.
7. The chair-in-exile (that's me) will declare your Flawless Victory and award prizes.
8. Rinse and repeat, until the festival expires. I will suddenly close it with no warning, YOU FOOLS!

Example:
1. A rewrite of the Servitor rules for Soth (including a new handout for players)
2. By Wednesday
3. HA HA HA!
4. By midnight
