  <p>In 2007 and 2011, +J. Walton hosted the Festival of Flawless Victory ( #FlawlessVictory ) for finishing work (usually a new draft) on unfinished projects.</p>

  <p>Over the course of these events, significant work was done on such games as: Geiger Counter, In a Wicked Age, A Flower for Mara, It's Complicated, Anima Prime, Mythender, Monster of the Week, Left Coast, and several others.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, SabreGreatWolf, Fey Wray, Powell Driver, D. Vincent, The Kenrick Man, Major Hickory, Wordman, and SandStorm were declared champions and eternal Flawless Grand-Champions.</p>

  <p>Now... the fighters have been recalled to the arena. The deathmatch for the fate of two worlds -- the real world and the corrupted world of imagination -- is at hand! Who will you fight? How will you write your name on the eternal role of champions?</p>

  <h2>The Eternal Rules of the Eternal Festival</h2>

  <p>Games are easy to start, but sometimes hard to finish. They are the like the green vegetables of the mind.</p>

  <p>Here's the eightfold path to achieving Flawless Victory:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Name your unfinished business.</li>
    <li>Pick a reasonable deadline for finishing it.</li>
    <li>Laugh loudly and arrogantly. HA HA HA! This is not optional.</li>
    <li>Pick a ridiculous deadline that is very imminent instead. One that makes Goro wince with its harshness.</li>
    <li>FINISH HIM!</li>
    <li>Post a link to your game and gloat.</li>
    <li>The chair-in-exile (that's me) will declare your Flawless Victory and award prizes.</li>
    <li>Rinse and repeat, until the festival expires. I will suddenly close it with no warning, YOU FOOLS!</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Example:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A rewrite of the Servitor rules for Soth (including a new handout for players)</li>
    <li>By Wednesday</li>
    <li>HA HA HA!</li>
    <li>By midnight</li>
  </ol>
